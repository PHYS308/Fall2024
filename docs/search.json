    "text": "Welcome to PHYS 308, Fall 2024!\nNot sure where to start? I’ve put together a guide.\nThis website contains the syllabus and an FAQ. If you are looking for handouts, in-class activities, specific assignments, or class slides, those will all be in the course page in Lyceum. If you are enrolled in the class but do not have access to Lyceum, please let me know immediately so I can add you.\n\nFill out the welcome form\nThe first thing you should do for this class is fill out the welcome form. This form is quick and should be completed by the end of the first week of class. It will help me to support you in this class and will only take a few minutes of your time!\n\n\nRead the syllabus\nI’ve tried to make the syllabus relatively short, sweet, and well-organized. It’s all on this website, so please take a minute to read the syllabus page.\n\n\nKeep an eye on the schedule\nThe schedule for this class is in a google doc so that it can be updated as needed. Sometimes, things happen. Those things might be snow days, illnesses, travel, or just needing more time than anticipated on a topic. If needed, I may move due dates or adjust readings or topics in the schedule. I will talk about these changes in the classroom, but if you ever need to check a due date, the schedule will have the most up-to-date information.\n\n\nStill have questions?\nIf you’ve read the syllabus and still have questions, check out the FAQ. If you have a question that’s not answered on that page, please feel free to email me! I’ve tried to collect the kinds of questions I get the most to save you time, but I know that not all questions can be answered with this website and am always happy to hear from you."

If you are going to use ChatGPT or a similar LLM in this class, I only require two things:\n\nThat you do a little reading on Large Language Models. Specifically, read this article about how LLMs actually work and this article about the ethical considerations around LLMs\nThat you consider ChatGPT a source that you must cite. If you use ChatGPT or another LLM to help with any assignment, you must acknowledge that help and give a short (one-sentence) description of what the LLM did for you and how it helped you solve the problem.\n\nRemember that LLMs are designed to predict the most probable response to a question, which is not always the best or even correct response. They are prone to “hallucinating” (making stuff up, often in a way that is convincing but still false). They can’t do creative problem solving, which is the most important skill we are teaching in this class."

    "text": "Assignments and Grading\nAssignments fall into “bundles,” which each make up a percent of the grade. Each assignment within a bundle is equally weighted, and individual assignments will all be graded with a rubric that includes the learning objectives, so that you can see very clearly what you missed.\n\nLetter grade table\nGrades will be determined from percentages using the following table:\n\nLetter grades\n\n\nLetter grade\nPercent range\n\n\n\n\nA\n92.5 ≤ x ≤ 100\n\n\nA-\n90 ≤ x &lt; 92.5\n\n\nB+\n87.5 ≤ x &lt; 90\n\n\nB\n82.5 ≤ x &lt; 87.5\n\n\nB-\n80 ≤ x &lt; 82.5\n\n\nC+\n77.5 ≤ x &lt; 80\n\n\nC\n72.5 ≤ x &lt; 77.5\n\n\nC-\n70 ≤ x &lt; 72.5\n\n\nD+\n67.5 ≤ x &lt; 70\n\n\nD\n62.5 ≤ x &lt; 67.5\n\n\nD-\n60 ≤ x &lt; 62.5\n\n\nF\n0 ≤ x &lt; 60\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading bundles\n\nGrowth Mindset (10%)Practice (30%)Labs and Lab Reports (25%)Jigsaw (25%)The Problem Project (10%)Extra Credit: Cornell Notes\n\n\nAn important element of being a scientist is seeing opportunities to improve from mistakes and failures. This is emphasized in this class in multiple ways, through homework and test re-dos as well as through the goal-setting assignment, which spans the entire semester. Please note that some of the deadlines are more rigid in this bundle in order to make it a useful activity.\n\nCourse pre-test (1 hr, graded on completion, not content)\nCourse post-test (1 hr, graded on completion, not content)\nMath Assessment (with two chances to re-take)\nGrowth Mindset Reflection\nSMART goal setting\nSMART goal mid-semester check-in\nSMART goal final reflection\n\nGiven the purpose of these activities, we will not offer extensions beyond one week on the deadlines for the Growth Mindset bundle, except in case of a major medical or family emergency.\n\n\nRegular problem-solving is very important to developing confidence and skill in this content, so every week you will have a short weekly problem set as well as a self-reflection form.\nYou will turn in the weekly problem set by scanning and uploading as a PDF to Moodle. These are due by midnight each Monday.\nThe weekly problem set are self-graded. Here’s how that works:\n\nYou get 50% of the points just for submitting the homework on time.\nWhen you submit your work, you will receive access to the solutions.\nThe rest of the points come from comparing your work to the solutions and filling out a guided self-reflection form.\nThese forms are not intended to make you do “extra work” – these are to help both you and your instructors understand where you need more practice and more support.\n\n\n\nLab activities will be integrated into many classes, and completing the labs is an important part of your learning in the course, so you may not use another student’s data for your homework problem or lab report. If you are unable to attend a class you may contact the instructor (in advance if possible) about finding a time to make up the lab work.\nWe will do a number of labs, but just two of them will include a report. These reports are more than just a short write-up of what you did. These are an exercise in synthesizing the concepts you learned in class with the activities you did in the laboratory.\nThe lab reports must include:\n\na short introductory paragraph putting into context the activity\na clear statement of the question you were trying to answer with the activity\nan explanation of the methods you used (what did you measure, how did you do it, how did you account for error, etc)\na visualization of your results (using plots and figures)\na discussion of what your results mean.\n\nThese reports are graded using this rubric.\nNote: We don’t ever expect you to have perfect data, so use the discussion as an opportunity to explain the problems that arose and what you might have done differently if you’d had more time.\nYou may revise and resubmit each lab report one time.\n\n\nThere will be three jigsaw activities during the semester, but you can drop your grade on one of them. In these activities, you will be given a challenging problem to solve in small groups. Together your group must write up a “lesson plan” that demonstrates how to approach and solve that problem. In the next class period, your group will teach that problem to the class, and then everyone individually must write up a second solution: you may pick any of the problems taught by another group.\nTo get credit for these jigsaws, you must:\n\nparticipate in both days of activity\nsubmit your “lesson plan” write-up for the question you were assigned\nsubmit a second write-up for one of the problems you learned on the second day\n\nThese jigsaws are graded using this rubric.\nYou may revise and resubmit each jigsaw write-up one time.\n\n\nThe student becomes the teacher… your final project for this class is to write a physics problem similar to the jigsaw problems. You must:\n\nselect at least one key idea from three of the five different groups\nwrite a physics problem that tests understanding those three key ideas\nwrite up a detailed solution to that problem using the four-step problem solving method\nexplain how your problem tests understanding for the three key ideas you selected\n\nThis will be graded using this rubric.\nBecause this is due on the last day of class, there will not be an opportunity to revise and resubmit this\n\n\nA good note-taking process can really help, not just with organization, but also with building the habit of reviewing critically the content of the past week. As extra credit, you can turn in weekly Cornell Notes.\n\nThis will include one initial assignment to demonstrate how to do Cornell Notes\nYou turn in a picture or scan of these in Moodle\nTo learn more about Cornell Notes, there is a detailed walkthrough in the FAQ\nCornell Notes assignments are graded with a rubric\n\nFor every four Cornell Notes assignments that you receive a “Satisfactory” or “Excellent” grade on (see rubric), we will round your grade up. So if you have a B and turn in four “Satisfactory” or “Excellent” Cornell Notes, your grade will become a B+. If you have eight “Satisfactory” or “Excellent” Cornell Notes, your grade will become an A-, etc.\nThe initial Cornell Notes assignment, while it contains three parts, is graded as one Cornell Notes, not three."

Please note, however, that some assignments will have harder deadlines. These assignments include the first Cornell Notes assignment, the math assessment, and all the Growth Mindset assignments. The reason for these hard deadlines is due to the nature of the assignments – for example, it is not helpful for you to put off taking the math assessment and discover in the last week of class that you really should review trig.\nYou can see which assignments have deadline restrictions by looking at the grading template."
